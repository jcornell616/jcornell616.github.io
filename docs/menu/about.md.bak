I'm in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Masters program at the University of Florida. My interests include embedded software, machine learning, statistical signal processing, and FPGA development.

I have experience as an Embedded Engineering intern at Lutron Electronics. At Lutron, I did design planning for adding capabilities to a sensor device, developed driver code for an ultrasonic sensor system, integrated the drivers with an existing algorithmic codebase, performed timing analysis on the system, and set up wireless communication with the sensor device. Interning at Lutron taught me valuable software engineering skills such as working effectively with a team, documenting your design, and implementing a design on a real-time device.

I am active in UF's Audio Engineering Society (AES) where I am the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Lead. This includes advising others on signal processing and machine learning applications, creating workshops on designing DSP algorithms and implementing them to work real-time on a device, and leading projects dealing with adaptive signal processing.

Outside of my career I enjoy writing music, playing guitar, wildlife photography, and scuba diving.
