**Interests:** *Machine learning, statistical signal processing, neural technology, brain-computer interfaces, deep learning, stochastic processes, embedded engineering, FPGA engineering, audio applications*

My name is Jackson Cornell and I'm in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Masters program at the University of Florida, for which I am poised to gradute in the Fall of 2023. My interests include machine learning, statistical signal processing, neural technology, and embedded software.

I have experience as an Embedded Engineering intern at Lutron Electronics. At Lutron, I did design planning for adding capabilities to a sensor device, developed
driver code for an ultrasonic sensor system, integrated the drivers with an existing algorithmic codebase, performed timing analysis on the system, and set up
wireless communication with the sensor device. Interning at Lutron taught me valuable software engineering skills such as working effectively with a team,
documenting your design, and implementing a design on a real-time device.

I am active in UF's Audio Engineering Society (AES) where I am the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Lead. This includes advising others on signal processing and
machine learning applications, creating workshops on designing DSP algorithms and implementing them to work real-time on a device, and leading projects dealing
with adaptive signal processing. I was also a TA for UF's Applied Machine Learning course, taught under Dr. Silva.

Outside of my career I enjoy writing music, playing guitar, wildlife photography, and scuba diving.
