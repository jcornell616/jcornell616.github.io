## Hello

Hello. I am Jackson, an electrical & computer engineering student with a passion for solving problems, music, and nature. I made this site as both a personal
portfolio and a place to share my ideas, photography, music, and more. 

## How I made this site

Github pages and Jekyll are great resources if you want to make a website but are html-phobic like me. I used the following guides to get started:

* [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

For all the pretty formatting, I used the below Jekyll template "Lagrange". A big thank you to the creator for it:
